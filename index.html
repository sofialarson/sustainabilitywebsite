    <p class="sansserif" style = "padding: 10px"> Sustainability is a goal. The aim is to maintain conditions where humans and nature can coexist to support present and future generations.
    Currently, we are falling short of that goal. At the rate that we are expending resources, the earth will not be able to support us for much longer. </p>

    <p style = "padding: 30px" class="sansserif"> Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the answer is likely no. It is for me too.
    We tend to think we do not produce THAT much waste, or waste THAT much water. But the only reason we have been living so comfortably
    without noticing our effect on the earth is because others do not have the same resources as us. If everyone lived as we do, the earth
    could not support us. Want to see exaclty how many earths we would need to support everyone if they lived your lifestyle? Try
