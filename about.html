    <p class = sansserif style = "padding: 60px"> Though sustainability is most commonly linked to the environment, we must also consider the economical
    and the social aspects in society to promote sustainability. These three spheres, the economic, social, and environmental spheres,
    are recognized as the three pillars of sustainability. </p>

        <div class = "words">
        <p class="sansserif" > Currently, the supply and demand market is
        consumerist in nature. In comparison to
        decades before, products have shorter
        lifecycles and are made from cheaper
        materials and labor. These factors,
        combined with the ease of online shopping,
        contributes to the increased amount of waste.
        Sustainability aims to break this cycle
        while considering the job market and profit. </p>

        <div class = "words">
        <p class="sansserif" > The social pillar is the most difficult to
        define, largely due to the variety of issues
        it covers. The social pillar covers topics
        such as sustainable housing, quality of
        life, diversity, and resource equitity. To summarize, anything that involves
        community or any form of
        collaboration, resulting in a lot of overlap
        with the other pillars. </p>

        <div class = "words">
        <p class="sansserif" > The general idea behind the environmental
        pillar is that we need to try to conserve
        more of our natural resources, such as trees,
        and water, and rely less on products that
        emit harmful substances to the environment.
        This pillar covers a variety of issues such
        as renewable energy, diet, and recycling.
        This pillar is the most well known since
        it covers the some of the most urgent issues.
